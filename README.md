## Overview

ProFit-PT is an e-commerce website where the customer can hire personal trainers for in person training, creating personalized workout plans, and fitness counseling.

This website was built as a project for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at Code Institute.

## Mockup

## UX

I started out with Wireframes for both desktop and mobile.

The basic structure for services and service details was created. I did not have any wireframes for the profile/cart/checkout, so I used the CI Boutique Ado walk-through for those pages.

After the base structure for viewing and purchasing services was complete, I moved on the the about/faqs/contact pages. Originally, I had planned for separate pages for all of them, but as the pages started taking shape, I combined some of their functionalities to make related information easier to find.

### Colour Scheme

-  `##4C4C4C` used for primary text.

-  `#f5f5f5` used for primary highlights.

-  `#FFFFFF` used for secondary text.

-  `#4C4C4CBF` used for secondary highlights.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ffffff-f5f5f5-4c4c4c) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the search icon and tag icon for categories.
