## Bugs

#### #01
- Front end login is blocked by e-mail verification

    - Fixed after adding front end verification

#### #02
- Not all services are displayed, and there are duplicates of services with multiple pricing tiers.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug01.1.png)
    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug01.2.png)
    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug01.3.png)

    - Fixed by adjusting all_services view to only display once. Fixed by using .distinct() and change ordering to name instead of pricingtier.

#### #03
- Pagination not scaling down properly.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug02.png)

    - Fixed by removed pagination arrows. They could not be styled easily, and there are already text buttons for next/previous.

#### #04
- When sorting using the "sort by" dropdown in the services list, it shows duplicates of the services

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug03.png)

    - Fixed by overhauling the service view. Duplicates were appearing because all pricing-tiers were being listed, but only the highest price was the price shown in the cards. Had to import/use Subquery and OuterRef to create more distinct filtering. sorting and splitting. JS had to be used as well.

#### #05
- The payment form doesn't get accepted on submission. When clicking Complete order, the button gets disabled, but nothing happens.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug04.png)

    - Fixed by identifying that I had a hidden input line inside the form:  `<input type="hidden" value="{{ client_secret }}" name="client_secret">`  
It was causing problems, since I did not have the client_secret set up yet. I had also copied the {{ stripe_public_key|json_script:"id_stripe_public_key"}} twice at the bottom of the file. I was missing {{ client_secret|json_script:"id_client_secret"}}.
Fix was to remove the field, and correct the json_scripts at the bottom of the page

#### #06
- TypeError when trying to add an item to the cart without selecting a quantity:

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug05.1.png)
    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug05.2.png)
    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug05.3.png)

    -  Fixed by creating add service_quantity check in view.

#### #07
- Inconsistent sorting for price (low-high) in services

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug06.1.png)
    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug06.2.png)

    - Could not find fix, see unfixed bugs.
